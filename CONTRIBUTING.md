# How to contribute

I'm really glad you're reading this, because we need volunteer developers to help this project come to fruition.

Here are some important things to check before open a pull request:

- Search previous suggestions before making a new one, as yours may be a duplicate.
- Make an individual pull request for each suggestion.
- Use the following format: `**Title.** Authors. *Journal/Conference/arXiv year*. [Resource](link)`
- If the resource has additional links, i.e. a paper with the code, append the link as `[Code](link)`
- The pull request and commit should have a useful title.

Thank you for your contribution!
